        <h1>WRITE BAD CODE: 1001 WAYS</h1>
        <p>I'm on a mission. A bold initiative. An event of cosmic proportions proportionate to properly proportioned portions.</p>
        <p>Here it is.</p> 
        <p>I'm on a mission to uncover 1001 ways to write bad code.</p>
        <p>If you follow these steps, as I have, I promise you'll be writing the worst code of your life!</p>

        <h2>FREQUENTLY ANSWERED QUESTIONS</h2>
        <ul class="FAQ-list">
            <li>Q: Why 1001? Is that really the max number of mistakes someone can make when coding?</li>
            <li>A: Good question. It's just a stretch goal. If I said 101, I think I could actually find 101 ways to write crap code. But 1001? That's truly impressive. That's next level bad. I want to reach that level of bad.</li>
            <li>Q: What is "bad code"?</li>
            <li>A: Great question! It's code that isn't good. Hope that clears is up for ya.</li>

        <h2>The WAYS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spend 12-14 hours on intensive coding learning per day for a few weeks without any proper time management, burn out, and develop the (in)ability to think or function in day to day life.</li>
            <li>Forget that you need to properly link your html, css, and script files and spend a few hours raging that nothing is working only to realize you're an idiot.</li>
            <li>Do basically the same thing but with a twist: neglect to properly understand how a page loads so you can invest an hour of mounting shame and rage that your query selectors aren't selecting even though you KNOW the code is right only to think that maybe, just maybe, the script in your header is trying to select html elements that don't exist yet, thus resulting in null values. So you spend 3 seconds to type `defer` and voila! it's fixed and you laugh and move on.</li>
            <li>Spend far more time watching other people code than coding yourself. This has the added benefit of not actually producing code, which we all no is the best bad code you can write.</li>
            <li>Skim through every amazing free piece of information that you can find about computers and coding without any intention to understand. Avoid being attentive and focused while reading.</li>
            <li>Spend zero time trying to learn about the essence of computers and their bits.</li>
            <li>Read as many headlines as you can about how the tech market is in the trash/tank/toots.</li>
            <li>Panic. Like all the time. Panic about every little thing that doesn't go your way. Panic about all the time you've wasted not coding. Panic about how much you don't understand but spend zero time on trying to understand. Just panic.</li>
            <li>Save resources for later rather than learning from them now.</li>
            <li>Worry more about how old your computer is and how that will hold you back than about how to modular your code is.</li>
            <li>Always assume you know more than the computer and that you are always right. (this one goes a very long way)</li>
            <li>Alternatively, always assume the computer is wrong.</li>
            <li>Specifically alternatively, believe in your bones that error messages are there to anger you ad insult your great intelligence, not help guide you to a solution.</li>
            <li>Never stop learning as fast as possible. Actually, faster than possible. Make sure to blast through every new concept like it's a meatball sub and you've just run a marathon. Just go through everything only once, just to give yourself the feeling of learning, but virtually garunteeing you'll never retain anything, and ideally confuse other concepts creating a disorganized soup of misinformation in your mind that resembles a blob fish but chunkier.</li>
            <li>And as you power through every article and tutorial and video, make sure you do not under any circumstance code along! If you actually type things you run the risk of teaching your hands. You do not want this! Smart hands are an invaluable tool for programmers. You only want hands that can scroll through feeds and tutorials as fast as possible, not instantiate objects.</li>
            <li>However, as you "progress' as a developer you'll be presented with new tools. Often you will find helpful tutorials that involve coding along. If this cannot be avoided, you are advised to simply pass the code like a hot potato from the tutorial to your text editor, never slowing down enough to understand how your code is working or why. Just type what you see. As long as it produces an outcome that matches the tutorial, you can feel accomplished and move on.</li>
            <li>Assume that if you could just write better code, then the world would be a better place. People wouldn't go hungry, ecosystems wouldn't be collapsing, the lumps in your mother's chest will come back benign. Forget the outside world. Believe that code is the way, the truth, and the light. And for 4ucks sake, stop making everything political. Just focus on the syntax and semantics and everything will be fine. All there every was and all there will every be is cold, hard, code.</li>
