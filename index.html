        <h1>WRITE BAD CODE: 1001 WAYS</h1>
        <p>I'm on a mission. A bold initiative. An event of cosmic proportions proportionate to properly proportioned portions.</p>
        <p>Here it is. I'm on a mission to uncover 1001 ways to write bad code.</p>
        <p>Come for the pain, stay for the laughs!</p>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul class="FAQ-list">
            <li>Q: Why 1001? Is that really the max number of mistakes someone can make when coding?</li>
            <li>A: Good question. It's just a stretch goal. If I said 101, I think I could actually find 101 ways to write crap code. But 1001? That's truly impressive. That's next level bad. I want to reach that level of bad.</li>
            <li>Q: What is "bad code"?</li>
            <li>A: Great question! It's code that isn't good. Hope that clears is up for ya.</li>

        <h2>The List</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Spend 12-14 hours on intensive coding learning per day for a few weeks without any proper time management, burn out, and develop the (in)ability to think or function in day to day life.</li>
            <li>Forget that you need to properly link your html, css, and script files and spend a few hours raging that nothing is working only to realize you're an idiot.</li>
            <li>Do basically the same thing but with a twist: neglect to properly understand how a page loads so you can invest an hour of mounting shame and rage that your query selectors aren't selecting even though you KNOW the code is right only to think that maybe, just maybe, the script in your header is trying to select html elements that don't exist yet, thus resulting in null values. So you spend 3 seconds to type `defer` and voila! it's fixed and you laugh and move on.</li>
